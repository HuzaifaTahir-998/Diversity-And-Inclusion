## Dashboards and Visualizations
### Call Centre Trends
The first dashboard provides a comprehensive view of call center metrics, focusing on customer satisfaction, call volumes, and agent performance. It aids in identifying areas for improvement in call center operations.
### Customer Churn & Retention
This dashboard was developed in response to a request from the telecom's Retention Manager, showcasing key customer loyalty and retention metrics. It visualizes data to predict customer churn and identifies potential strategies to enhance customer retention.

#### Key Findings:
1. Overall Churn Rate:
  - Of 7043 customers, 1869 have churned, resulting in a churn rate of approximately 26.5%.
2. Contract Type:
  - Among the 1869 churned customers, 88.6% had a month-to-month contract. 
  - Long-term contracts have a significantly lower churn rate, indicating customer retention is stronger with these contracts.
3. Service Usage:
  - Phone Service: 
    90.9% of churned customers had phone service, compared to 90.1% of active customers. This suggests that having phone service does not significantly impact churn rates.
  - Internet Service:
    Among active users, 27.31% do not have internet services.
    Of those who churned, only 6.05% opted not to have internet service, indicating that around 94% of customers who left were using internet services. 
  - Tech Support: Among these 94%, 82.4% did not opt for tech support.
4. Billing Preferences:
  - The churn rate among customers who opted for paperless billing is 33.6%, compared to 16.3% for those who did not opt for paperless billing.
  - 1400 out of 1869 churned customers, or about 75%, had paperless billing.
#### Recommendations:
- Promote Long-term Contracts: Offer incentives for switching to long-term contracts to reduce churn.
- Enhance Internet Services and Support: Improve service quality and promote tech support subscriptions.
- Review Paperless Billing: Investigate higher churn rates and enhance the user experience.
- Implement Retention Programs: Reward long-term customers with discounts and exclusive offers.
